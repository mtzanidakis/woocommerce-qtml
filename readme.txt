*** WooCommerce-qTML by SomewhereWarm ***

WooCommerce-qTML is an experimental plugin that adds basic qTranslate support to WooCommerce. 

WooCommerce-qTML: 

1. ensures that qTranslate will remember language selections when navigating between the product, cart and checkout pages of WooCommerce.
2. fixes the translation of product attributes and a number of other WooCommerce front-end strings.
3. fixes a number of redirection issues, for example, after posting product reviews.

IMPORTANT NOTE

Certain multi-lingual functionalities may not be work as expected, due to Wordpress / WooCommerce limitations. If in doubt, just drop us an e-mail.

Every version of WooCommerce-qTML is written with a specific combination of Wordpress, qTranslate and WooCommerce versions in mind. The exact version numbers can be found in changelog.txt.

Using the plugin with different versions of WooCommerce/Wordpress is not recommended, since new versions always introduce changes that may break the translation of a few strings, or, in extreme cases, even entire pages. You can always give it a shot and see if another combination works for you. However, we strongly encourage you to:

1. Always backup your entire website before updating WooCommerce or WordPress.
2. Check that a new version of WooCommerce-qTML exists before updating WC or WP.

WooCommerce-qTML will be updated as long as qTranslate and WooCommerce are active and maintained.

Keep in mind that this is an experimental release - some things may not work as expected without small core modifications, due to WooCommerce/Wordpress limitations.
